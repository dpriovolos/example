# Face to Sketch and Sketch to Face using Deep Autoencoders

This project involves the development of a deep autoencoder using Python Keras and Tensorflow libraries, with the purpose to accurately convert face images with specific backround to sketches and the opposite. There are 3 models displayed. One fully Dense layers autoencoder, one autoencoder created with convolutional layers (CNN) and one original model created by combining those two types of layers. In between those layers some other layers are used like Pooling layers and Dropout layers for regularization. The project uses the publicly available data set CUHK Sketch Database (CUFS) that can be found in Kaggle.
